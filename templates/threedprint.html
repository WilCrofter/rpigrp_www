<h1>3D Printing</h1>

<p>A brief description of our hardware and plans might be here.</p>

<p>There would be an area in which 3D designers could drag and drop files to be printed. The area would require a login of course. This is just a mockup.</p>

<p>There would also be an area in which we could see the 3D print jobs in action. It would be livestreamed via a Pi Camera pointed at the Rep Rap. This will be exciting.</p>
